## **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain was exploring how model evaluation metrics differ when analyzing text generated by large language models. Understanding the trade-offs between automated metrics and human judgment was fascinating because it showed how machine evaluation can fail to capture nuance.

## **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I'd like to investigate how effective multi step ouput refinement can be for these models. I want to see if it works and then improve on what it is already doing.

## **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
More hands on, more meetings, more time spent on the project. While it is difficult to make the time I think it could have been possible to get more work done if we tried to not always have everyone available for each meeting.

## **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I think I would be interested in using synthetic data. From some of the research I have read synthetic data seems to be a very interesting way to see how a model performs and I would like to explore it's uses.
